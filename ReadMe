in this project you have at least 2 - 5 subclasses
in each subclass you have getters and setters to define the instances
& in each subclass you also have constructors to outline the instances and in this overall project the instances are ingredients
for bread and different types of bread that can be created using different types of ingredients
you are supposed to be able to print what ingredients each class takes and what the recipe is supposed to be for each class
